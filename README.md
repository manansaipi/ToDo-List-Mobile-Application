# ✅ To-do List Mobile Application – Task Management with Location & Notifications

This is a **Flutter-based To-do List Application** designed to boost productivity through structured planning, location tracking, and smart notifications. Built entirely by me from scratch, this app leverages **SQFLite** for local data storage and **Google Maps API** for real-time location-based task association.
